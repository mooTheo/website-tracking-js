#Deployment

##Test
For now there is only one environment. It is called 'test'.
In this environment tracker library is served as static content
via nginx on the same machine where tracker backend is set up.
When tracker backend is deployed to AWS EB it pulls particular S3
bucket to get tracker library.
So to make it available we must upload tracker library to S3.
It is done with the script:
  ./scripts/publish-to-s3-test
